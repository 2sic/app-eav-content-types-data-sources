# app-eav-content-types-data-sources

Dev app for building and maintaining content-types relevant to configuring EAV data sources (for 2sic developers)

## Existing Content Types:
1. SqlDataSource for 2sxc 9.8
1. Shuffle DataSource for 2sxc 9.8
1. RelationshipFilter for 2sxc 9.9
1. Apps for 2sxc 9.12
1. Attributes for 2sxc 9.12
1. Zones for 2sxc 9.12
1. QueryInfo for 2sxc 9.12

## Work In Progress
(none)


## Next probably
1. 



## Warning
This app is very difficult to install, because it must circumvent certain automations on the EAV. So you can't just install in on any EAV / 2sxc. 

I'll write some instructions some day, but ATM just be aware of the fact that it's not easy, but that's by design.
